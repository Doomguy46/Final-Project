# Final-Project
The intent is to create a easy to use(Including UI) System that will let me quickly note things, such as dates, and put them into a text file that is easily readable.

# Description
This is a word processor, it is meant to take notes in class, so has headers, subheaders, and bullet points. It also, importantly, records audio for you, which the input for can be changed in settings. It is the ultimate note taker, as it will also create the folder for you, organize it into dates and classes. It's perfect for what you need!
